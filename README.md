# Mini DevOps Pipeline

## 🚀 Project Overview
This is a **Mini DevOps Pipeline project** built using **Bash scripts**, **Docker**, and **Nginx**.  
It demonstrates how a simple CI/CD look like: 

1. **Build** – Prepare your HTML application.  
2. **Deploy** – Deploy the app inside a Dockerized Nginx server.  
3. **Monitor** – Check if Nginx is running and restart if necessary.  
4. **Pipeline** – Automate the above steps using a single `pipeline.sh` script.  

## 📁 Project Structure
